    <p>Hello. I am Steve.</br> I am a Northcoders student.</br> I have spent the last ten years teaching my way around the world!  My background is in English language teaching and linguistics.  I am particularly interested in technology-enhanced language learning, and computer-assisted language analysis.  I believe these fields are lagging behind the rest of the tech sector and offer many untapped opportunities for innovative software applications.  Consequently, I have decided to embark on my next great adventure and retrain as a full-stack software developer. </p>
