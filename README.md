# Northcoders Portfolio - Self Guided Week

During the **Self Guided Week** of the Remote Bootcamp we would like you to dedicate as much time as you can to develop your HTML and CSS skills. This will help prepare you for the next half of the course.

So far you've developed your skills in application logic using JavaScript. Understanding how to utilise HTML & CSS to build web pages is an important prerequisite skill for frontend development, and will provide you with the skills to build the views of our application.

HTML and CSS are big subjects, which are easy to learn and hard to master. By the end of this week, you should have learned the basics and feel comfortable producing simple webpages.

Even if frontend roles don't appeal to you, understanding HTML and CSS to this level will be critical going forwards - we will use both heavily throughout the next half of the course, and having an attractive portfolio and projects is one of the best ways of securing a role quickly.

The aim of this task is to end up with a simple, elegant and well-executed portfolio page that you can take away and publicise at the end of the course, with links to the projects you've created. Consider it a project in its own right - a way for you to advertise your skills in writing best-practise HTML and CSS!

## Things to consider

If you've no experience with HTML and/or CSS, please see the **HTML & CSS basics** section in the resources.md file of this repository

Your portfolio site should be...

- **responsive** - it should be functional at different screen sizes (e.g. mobile, desktop)(see section in resources.md)
- **accessible** - it should employ good practises for those using alternative means to access the website, i.e. screen readers (see section in resources.md)
- **readable** - it should be readable, not least for potential employers who might want to view the source code of your site
- **attractive** - it should look good!

...and it should have...

- a home/about page
- a portfolio list with links
- contact details

...across multiple pages with internal links.

## Steps to follow

1. Before you start any work on your portfolio site please watch the following videos:

   - [Links, images and additional HTML](https://northcoders.wistia.com/medias/9orakqv2h6)

2. Create your own GitHub repo for this task. Clone it to your computer.
3. Create a structure inside this folder to hold your website assets. There's a guide on how to do this on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files).
4. Build your site! We suggest starting with the basic HTML structure, then bringing in CSS and any other JavaScript when you are happy with the content.
5. Remember to add and commit your changes frequently as you work.
6. When you're ready to show the world, you might want to look at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a solution for deploying.
